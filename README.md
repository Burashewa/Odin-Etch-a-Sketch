# Odin-Etch-a-Sketch

## Description

This is the Etch-a-Sketch project from The Odin Project. It allows users to color grid cells by hovering over them.

This project was a bit challenging, but it was really interesting to work with DOM manipulation, Flexbox in CSS, and JavaScript logic. I gained valuable experience while building it.
